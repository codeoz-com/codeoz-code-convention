For information on GitHub Pages, see [](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll)

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/codeoz-com/codeoz-code-convention/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

For configuration options, see [Configuration](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/) on Jekyll site.
